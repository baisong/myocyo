Make Your Own Choose Your Own Adventure Story

My idea for a non-trivial web app to build and begin learning Yesod (Haskell) web framework.

# Spec

* easy to sign up / authenticate
* simple CRUD for 'story' posts
* editor allows branching storylines
* when you're done, send to friends with a short URL
* public/private setting
* browse public stories
